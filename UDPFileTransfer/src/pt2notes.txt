Network simulator:
command in eos: startmininet
ctrl + alt to free mouse
username: mininet
password: mininet
ssh -Y mininet@ip address

run simulator: sudo mn -x
have two hosts: h1 & h2, connected by a switch s1
try command: ifconfig

to simulate packet loss:
tc qdisc add dev s1-eh1 root netem loss 20%
at this point, only losing 20% of data in one direction...
use same command for: s1-eh2

'add' for first time you add a rule
replace with 'change' when changing./

to simulate duplication:
replace 'loss' with 'duplicate'
this overrides previous command.
to  run both at the same time, put them on the same command line:
'loss 20% duplicate 20%'

to get packets out of order:
'delay 10ms 20%' meaning, 20% of packets do not get delayed.
if delay is long enough, like a second, then reorder command will work  again.

to test: use ~100ms.
 at least 20% loss, duplicate.
 
 For packet corruption:
 exit simulator (not vm), save and copy .py file into vm. 
 scp packetcorrupt.py mininet@ipaddress: (with colon at the end)
 cp packetcorrupt.py pox/ext (move file to this  location)
 sudo mn -x ....
 cd pox in controller window
 ./pox.py packetcorrupt
 This will flip single bits in 20% of the packets.
 when done: sudo shutdown -h now
 
 Answer YES to closing window about storage.
 
 sudo apt-get update
 sudo apt-get install JDK
 (Install jdk through VM, then able to use in simulator)
